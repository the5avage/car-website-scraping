    Thank you for your interest in this vehicle. According to a specification of Volkswagen
    AG, we as the seller are obliged to inform you of the following facts with regard
    to this vehicle before the conclusion of the purchase contract. vehicles currently
    have a function in which the exhaust gas recirculation rate is gradually reduced/adjusted
    outside a certain temperature range (“thermo window”). The exhaust gas recirculation
    rate for vehicles is also gradually reduced in relation to the height of the vehicle
    above sea level (\"altitude correction\"). In addition, there is a function in
    a number of vehicles that causes the exhaust gas recirculation to be completely
    shut down after the engine has been running continuously for several minutes when
    idling (“taxi switch”).'

    Thank you for your interest in this vehicle. According to a specification of Volkswagen
    AG, we as the seller are obliged to inform you of the following facts with regard
    to this vehicle before the conclusion of the purchase contract. vehicles currently
    have a function in which the exhaust gas recirculation rate is gradually reduced/adjusted
    outside a certain temperature range (“thermo window”). The exhaust gas recirculation
    rate for vehicles is also gradually reduced in relation to the height of the vehicle
    above sea level (\"altitude correction\"). In addition, there is a function in
    a number of vehicles that causes the exhaust gas recirculation to be completely
    shut down after the engine has been running continuously for several minutes when
    idling (“taxi switch”).'

    Thank you for your interest in this vehicle. According to a specification of Volkswagen
    AG, we as the seller are obliged to inform you of the following facts with regard
    to this vehicle before the conclusion of the purchase contract. vehicles currently
    have a function in which the exhaust gas recirculation rate is gradually reduced/adjusted
    outside a certain temperature range (“thermo window”). The exhaust gas recirculation
    rate for vehicles is also gradually reduced in relation to the height of the vehicle
    above sea level (\"altitude correction\"). In addition, there is a function in
    a number of vehicles that causes the exhaust gas recirculation to be completely
    shut down after the engine has been running continuously for several minutes when
    idling (“taxi switch”).'

    vehicle conformity for this vehicle. We would like to inform you as a seller:
    The European Court of Justice has recently commented on exhaust gas cleaning systems
    in vehicles in several decisions and has significantly tightened the requirements
    for their justification. The interpretation of the regulatory requirements for
    emission control systems is understood as a result of the new decisions of the
    European Court of Justice. This can be seen, among other things, that the established
    administrative practice of the registration authorities is questioned by many
    sides. For this reason, too, there is still a lot of discussion in public about
    vehicle properties such as their emissions and fuel consumption. This applies
    in particular to the admissibility of certain software functions in motors and
    driven, their calibration, the control of parts of the emission control systems
    and their technical necessity.'
